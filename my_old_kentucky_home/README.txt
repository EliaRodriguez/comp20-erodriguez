ASSIGNMENT: LAB 6 - MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME
ELIA RODRIGUEZ LOPEZ

1. IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE FUNCTION. IT TURNED OUT THAT THE TIME WASN'T UPDATING, AND SO THE LYRICS WOULDN'T SHOW UP. THAT WAS FIXED BY INCLUDING THE FUNCTION IN THE EVENTLISTENER AND USING THIS TO REFER TO THE VIDEO'S CURRENT TIME. 

2. I COLLABORATED WITH PULTIK JAIN TO FINISH THIS ASSIGNMENT. I ALSO USED CODE PROVIDED IN THE DOUBLE RAINBOW EXAMPLE (BY RACHEL SULMONTE), SPECIFICALLY FOR THE FORMAT OF THE JAVASCRIPT FUNCTION. I ALSO REFERENCED THE PIAZZA FORUMS. THE IMAGES IN THE LYRICS WERE CREATED BY:
	- LUCIERICEPRINTS ON ETSY
	- PENMEETPAPER (KRISTEN VASGAARD INGEBRETSON) ON ETSTY https://www.etsy.com/listing/122427365/my-old-kentucky-home-hand-lettering

3. IT TOOK ME LIKE A WEEK TO FINISH THIS ASSIGNMENT.
