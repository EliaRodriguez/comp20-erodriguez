ASSIGNMENT: LAB 7 - MY MESSAGES
ELIA RODRIGUEZ LOPEZ

1. JSON.PARSE WAS IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY. HOPEFULLY I CAN SUBMIT THE LAB AND VIEW IT ON THE LOCALHOST PORT #8000 WITHOUT ANY ISSUES. 

2. FOR THIS LAB I USED THE PIAZZA FORUM AND CLASS NOTES AS A REFERENCE. I ALSO FOUND THIS TUTORIAL HELPFUL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtuHeWyDJqQ OR JAVASCRIPT TUTORIAL - HOW TO PARSE JSON STRING? JSON.PARSE() BY WEBTUNINGS

3. I SPENT APPROXIMATELY 3-4 HOURS ON THIS ASSIGNMENT. IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME A LOT LESS TIME, BUT I USED JSONDATA.PARSE INSTEAD OF JSON.PARSE, AND THEN FOR SOME REASON IT WOULDN’T WORK ON SCRATCHPAD. IT WASN’T UNTIL I MOVED TO JSFIDDLE THAT I REALIZED THE CODE ACTUALLY WORKED.
