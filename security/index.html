			Security Assessment of a Web Application <br />
			<span id='subheading'>Assessment by Elia Rodriguez Lopez for COMP-20 Web Programming</span>
		</header>

		<div>
			<h1 class='sections'>Introduction</h1>
				<p>The client has requested that a security and privacy analysis be perormed on a web application. The web application was built in Node.js Express and includes MongoDB. The objective of this report is to locate and identify security and privacy vulnerabilities in the source code and package.json files, assess the severity of these vulnerabilites, and provide recommendations on how to fix these issues. 
				</p>
		</div>


		<div>
			<h2 class='sections'>Methodology</h2>
			<p>The web application was tested using two methods: black box and white box testing. No further methods or tools were used.</p>
			<p>The black box test method was completed first, and consisted of sending the server malicious script through the terminal and the url string query. The black box method was unsuccessful, and the second method - the white box test - was completed. </p>
			<p>During white box testing, the source code (server-vuln.js and package.json) was downloaded and reviewed for any vulnerabilities. Portions of code that were suspected to be vulnerable to hacking were targeted for attack when the web application was opened. These attacks were sent using javascript's curl.</p>
		</div>


		<div>
			<h3 class='sections'>Abstract of Findings</h3>
			<p>The main vulnerability of the web application is that user input is not scanned for malicious script. When one checks in to the web application, the user can enter any text or script that they would like into the web application. This script, submitted by the user, is also not isolated from the rest of the code, so the web application runs and executes this code, interfering with the website's function. I also suspect that there is a vulnerability regarding the ability for one user to see all other user's data, but further testing needs to be done to prove this. </p>

			<h4 class='sections'>Issues Found</h4>
			<h5><span class='issues'>Issue: Cross-Site Scripting</span><span class='rating'>Severity: High</span></h5>
				<ul><li><span class='subheading'>Location:</span> POST route in server</li>
					<li><span class="subheading">Description:</span> The problem was found by reading the source code and scanning for vulnerabilities. I noticed that one of the entries into the database, the login parameter, is not encoded or checked for suspicious characters. I then used curl to input javascript code into the login parameter. This script was sent to the server and executed by the website. You can see I entered an alert displaying "give me your money," an image, and was able to redirect the web page using javascript.  </li>
					<li>The severity of this issue is high, because the function of this website can be severly compromised, and due to the storage of this malicious script or html using MongoDB, the issue is persistent. That is, that is, since the database is not cleared after the page is refreshed or the server restarted, the malicious scripts run each type the page is refreshed.</li>
					<li>This issue can be resolved by encoding and isolating the login input. Verification of the data can prevent the web application from running script and html submitted by the user.</li>
				</ul>
			<h6><span class='issues'>Issue: SQL Injection</span><span class='rating'>Severity: High</span></h6>
				<ul><li><span class='subheading'>Location:</span> GET 'checkins.json'</li>
					<li><span class="subheading">Description:</span> Although this vulnerability is not confirmed, another classmate mentioned an injection vulnerability that allows the user to see a list of all users and checkins instead of empty brackets. This could possibly occur by manipulating the GET route for '/checkins.json' and sending malicious script using the appropriate curl commands in the terminal.</li>
					<li>The severity of this issue is high, because potentially sensitive and personal user information could be stolen and shown to the public.</li>
					<li>This issue can be probably be resolved by not allowing the route to accept any data not from the same origin.</li>
				</ul>				
		</div>


		<div>
			<h7 class='sections'>Conclusion</h5>
			<p>Incoming data should always be encoded and isolated from the rest of the web application's code in order to remove any malicious script. The client should make sure that users can only input data in the appropriate routes.
