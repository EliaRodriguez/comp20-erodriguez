ASSIGNMENT: LAB 5 CSS SPRITES
ELIA RODRIGUEZ LOPEZ

1. CSS RESPONSIVE FILE WAS IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY. THE CORRECT IMAGE APPEARS FOR EACH SCREEN-SIZE. I HAD SOME TROUBLE USING GIT PUSH, AND SO HAD TO USE GIT PULL —REBASE ORIGIN MASTER AND GIT PUSH ORIGIN MASTER TO PUBLISH SITE. HOPEFULLY I CAN ADD THE README.TXT FILE CORRECTLY. 

2. I WORKED ON THIS ASSIGNMENT BY MYSELF, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF VIEWING THE PIAZZA FORUM AND VIEWING ONLINE REFERENCES. 

3. I CAN’T ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE TIME. (IT’S BEEN A WHILE.)

4. TEXT FORMAT.
