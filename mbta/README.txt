ASSIGNMENT: LAB 8/10 - MBTA REDLINE MAP
ELIA RODRIGUEZ LOPEZ

1. I think that the only thing that was not implemented correctly was feeding the JSON data through the various of loops to receive a time estimate of when the next train was arriving. I get a different result than the online example. I think that what is happening is that it is feeding the train times for ALL of the trains instead of just one station into the info window, but I’m not totally sure that is what is happening. 
	I found that a lot of my issues and the places I got stuck on had to do with issues regarding scopes and passing arguments from function to function. 

2. I had a lot of help from the TA’s, and for Part 10 I closely followed the redline.js file example that was posted online. For various other issues I consulted stack overflow and the google maps developer pages. 

3. I spent the last few weeks of class working on this project. I estimate that Lab 10 took me about ten hours, and that was because when I got stuck I looked at the example posted online. The nested for-loops through the json file was particularly difficult to parse through, and I think it is still a little off.
